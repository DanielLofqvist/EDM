<h3>Where can you find seagulls?</h3>
<p>The gulls have a worldwide cosmopolitan distribution. They breed on every continent, 
  including the margins of Antarctica, and are found in the high Arctic, as well. 
  They are less common on tropical islands, 
  although a few species do live on islands such as the Galapagos and New Caledonia.</p>

        <h3>What do they eat or drink?</h3>
      
        <p>Charadriiform birds drink salt water, as well as fresh water, as they possess exocrine glands located in 
        supraorbital grooves of the skull by which salt can be excreted through the nostrils to assist the kidneys in 
        maintaining electrolyte balance.</p>

        <p>When you search online, you could be lucky and end up with a picture of a Seagull.</p>

        <h3>Breeding</h3>
          <p>Gulls are monogamous and colonial breeders that display mate fidelity that usually lasts for the life of the pair. 
            Divorce of mated pairs does occur, but it apparently has a social cost that persists for a number of years after the break-up.</p>
            <p>Sometimes they like to carry eachother around:</p>
