<h3>Where are seagulls to be found?</h3>
<p>The gulls have a worldwide cosmopolitan distribution. They breed on every continent, 
  including the margins of Antarctica, and are found in the high Arctic, as well. 
  They are less common on tropical islands, 
  although a few species do live on islands such as the Galapagos and New Caledonia.</p>

        <h3>What do they eat or drink?</h3>

        <p>Charadriiform birds drink salt water, as well as fresh water, as they possess exocrine glands located in 
        supraorbital grooves of the skull by which salt can be excreted through the nostrils to assist the kidneys in 
        maintaining electrolyte balance.</p>
